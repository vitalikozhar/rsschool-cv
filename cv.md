## Profile


Hi! My name is Vitali Kozhar, and I live in a small town by the sea. My main goal in life is to take care of my family and ensure their well-being. I consider myself an energetic and proactive person with many ideas that I'm not afraid to bring to life. Things don't always go as planned, but my confidence and determination help me overcome any challenges.

I am a geologist by profession, and I love my job. Exploring the earth and understanding its processes is my passion. I am always open to new hobbies and have tried my hand at music, business, and agriculture. Learning new things is part of my nature, and I'm not afraid to make mistakes because thatâ€™s also an experience. Life is an adventure, and I strive to live it to the fullest!
